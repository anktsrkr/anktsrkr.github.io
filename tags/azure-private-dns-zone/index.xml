      <description>Hi Everyone!
In this post we are are going to explore different ways to connect Azure PaaS resources from On-premise network privately and securely. While deploying Azure PaaS service such as Azure SQL, Azure Storage etc. it always come with public facing endpoint many customer was not happy with that because of security concerns. So Microsoft introduces Virtual Network Service Endpoints. This will allow customers to secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network.</description>

      <description>Hi Everyone!
We have already implemented Hub-Spoke topology, and we are able to connect all the resources using IP from on premises network. But it is easier to use domain name instead ip directly from your virtual network. Also, If you want to use Azure Private Link, you need something which will resolve private link dns to respective ip. Other example is you have ASE v2 which comes with own domain but for your internal use you want some custom domain name which is easy to remember and also satisfy business need.</description>
