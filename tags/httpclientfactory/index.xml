      <description>Recently, Polly team did fabulous job ðŸŽ‰ by releasing the new version 8.0.0. It has lot of improvements and also they re-implemented Policy as Strategy. Polly v8 introduces the concept of resilience pipelines, a powerful tool that put together one or more resilience strategies.Here is the all changes you can find.
The Problem Microsoft provides a extension Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly  which allows us to use Polly with HttpClientFactory. It is very easy to use and you can find the documentation here.</description>

To make your .NET based applications more ressilient and fault tolerant, go to solution is to use Polly. Probably, you are already using it. So,I&amp;rsquo;m not going to explain how to use it in general. You can find some excellent documentation here.
However, In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss about one of the typical scenario where we need to refresh the authentication token when using Polly.</description>
