      <description>Hi Everyone!
As you are aware I have decided to move away from MOQ and insted we will use FakeItEasy for mocking the Azure Storage SDK. This post is adoptation of this which is using Moq.
You can find the full series of how to perform unit and integration tests for Azure Blob Storage using Azurite Test Containers, and xUnit.

      <description>Hi Everyone!
In this post, we will discuss about the alternative framework for mocking. This post is adoptation of this which is using Moq.

      <description>We, as C# developers, are used to throwing exceptions everywhere be it a functional such as validation or technical such as network failure. But is it worth throwing exceptions everywhere? Exceptions are expensive. You should not throw exceptions everywhere. You should throw exceptions only when it is necessary. But how? Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the alternative approach.
Types of exceptions in general Excellent article by Eric Lippert on exceptions, where you can find the types of exceptions in general.</description>

      <description>Recently, Polly team did fabulous job 🎉 by releasing the new version 8.0.0. It has lot of improvements and also they re-implemented Policy as Strategy. Polly v8 introduces the concept of resilience pipelines, a powerful tool that put together one or more resilience strategies.Here is the all changes you can find.
The Problem Microsoft provides a extension Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly  which allows us to use Polly with HttpClientFactory. It is very easy to use and you can find the documentation here.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s world, we are using a lot of APIs to build our applications. To make your .NET based applications more ressilient and fault tolerant, go to solution is to use Polly. Probably, you are already using it. So,I&amp;rsquo;m not going to explain how to use it in general. You can find some excellent documentation here.
However, In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss about one of the typical scenario where we need to refresh the authentication token when using Polly.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was working on a project where we had to download multiple large files from Azure Blob Storage and process it further. When the application hits the production environment and started getting the actual files, we observed that memory consumption is getting very high. On top of that, the application was hosted in shared windows based app service plan, which was making it even worse for other applications too.</description>

      <description>Security is the ❤️ of any application but sometimes we need to balance security with usability. Sometimes you want to allow users to access a resource with a lower level of authentication by just entering username and password. But if the user wants to access a resource with a higher level of authentication, then you want to ask the user to enter a second factor of authentication.
For instance, if you are building a money transfer application, you want to allow users to view transaction history or adding a new beneficiary with just a username and password.</description>
