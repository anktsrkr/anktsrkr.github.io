      <description>Security is the ❤️ of any application but sometimes we need to balance security with usability. Sometimes you want to allow users to access a resource with a lower level of authentication by just entering username and password. But if the user wants to access a resource with a higher level of authentication, then you want to ask the user to enter a second factor of authentication.
For instance, if you are building a money transfer application, you want to allow users to view transaction history or adding a new beneficiary with just a username and password.</description>

Getting Started with Nuke
Write your first building block in Nuke
Manage your Package Version using Nuke
This Post - Manage your Package Release using Nuke in Github
In our last post, we ran the build successfully in our local machine.</description>

      <description>Hi Everyone!
In this post we are are going to explore different ways to connect Azure PaaS resources from On-premise network privately and securely. While deploying Azure PaaS service such as Azure SQL, Azure Storage etc. it always come with public facing endpoint many customer was not happy with that because of security concerns. So Microsoft introduces Virtual Network Service Endpoints. This will allow customers to secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network.</description>

      <description>Hi Everyone!
We have already implemented Hub-Spoke topology, and we are able to connect all the resources using IP from on premises network. But it is easier to use domain name instead ip directly from your virtual network. Also, If you want to use Azure Private Link, you need something which will resolve private link dns to respective ip. Other example is you have ASE v2 which comes with own domain but for your internal use you want some custom domain name which is easy to remember and also satisfy business need.</description>
