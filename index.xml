      <description>Hi Everyone!&#xA;With this post, I am starting a new series about Semantic Kernel. Over the time, I will updated this page with links to individual posts :&#xA;This Post - Getting Started with Semantic Kernel (Part 1)&#xA;What is Semantic Kernel? Semantic Kernel is a lightweight, open-source development kit that provides a framework for building AI applications using large language models (LLMs). It allows developers to create and manage complex workflows, integrate with various AI services, and leverage the power of LLMs in their applications.</description>

      <description>Icon used in this post is property of FusionCache repo.&#xA;In today&amp;rsquo;s event-driven programming world, we are using lots of Azure Function as the serverless solution that allows us to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Azure Function comes with various triggers such as HttpTrigger, ServiceBusTrigger, SqlTrigger etc. which help us build an API easily.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say the team already built a HttpTrigger API GetProductsById and the data is coming from Azure SQL.</description>

      <description>We, as C# developers, are used to throwing exceptions everywhere be it a functional such as validation or technical such as network failure. But is it worth throwing exceptions everywhere? Exceptions are expensive. You should not throw exceptions everywhere. You should throw exceptions only when it is necessary. But how? Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the alternative approach.&#xA;Types of exceptions in general Excellent article by Eric Lippert on exceptions, where you can find the types of exceptions in general.</description>

      <description>Recently, Polly team did fabulous job 🎉 by releasing the new version 8.0.0. It has lot of improvements and also they re-implemented Policy as Strategy. Polly v8 introduces the concept of resilience pipelines, a powerful tool that put together one or more resilience strategies.Here is the all changes you can find.&#xA;The Problem Microsoft provides a extension Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly which allows us to use Polly with HttpClientFactory. It is very easy to use and you can find the documentation here.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s world, we are using a lot of APIs to build our applications. To make your .NET based applications more ressilient and fault tolerant, go to solution is to use Polly. Probably, you are already using it. So,I&amp;rsquo;m not going to explain how to use it in general. You can find some excellent documentation here.&#xA;However, In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss about one of the typical scenario where we need to refresh the authentication token when using Polly.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was working on a project where we had to download multiple large files from Azure Blob Storage and process it further. When the application hits the production environment and started getting the actual files, we observed that memory consumption is getting very high. On top of that, the application was hosted in shared windows based app service plan, which was making it even worse for other applications too.</description>

      <description>Security is the ❤️ of any application but sometimes we need to balance security with usability. Sometimes you want to allow users to access a resource with a lower level of authentication by just entering username and password. But if the user wants to access a resource with a higher level of authentication, then you want to ask the user to enter a second factor of authentication.&#xA;For instance, if you are building a money transfer application, you want to allow users to view transaction history or adding a new beneficiary with just a username and password.</description>

      <description>Hi Everyone!&#xA;In this post we are are going to explore different ways to connect Azure PaaS resources from On-premise network privately and securely. While deploying Azure PaaS service such as Azure SQL, Azure Storage etc. it always come with public facing endpoint many customer was not happy with that because of security concerns. So Microsoft introduces Virtual Network Service Endpoints. This will allow customers to secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network.</description>

      <description>Hi Everyone!&#xA;We have already implemented Hub-Spoke topology, and we are able to connect all the resources using IP from on premises network. But it is easier to use domain name instead ip directly from your virtual network. Also, If you want to use Azure Private Link, you need something which will resolve private link dns to respective ip. Other example is you have ASE v2 which comes with own domain but for your internal use you want some custom domain name which is easy to remember and also satisfy business need.</description>
