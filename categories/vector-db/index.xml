      <description>Hi Everyone! This post is continuation of a series about Semantic Kernel. Over the time, I will updated this page with links to individual posts :&#xA;Getting Started with Semantic Kernel (Part 1)&#xA;Getting Started with Semantic Kernel (Part 2)&#xA;Building Blocks of Semantic Kernel&#xA;This Post - Getting Started with Foundry Local &amp;amp; Semantic Kernel&#xA;So far, we have discussed theorical aspects of Semantic Kernel. In this post, we will focus on practical aspects of using Semantic Kernel with Foundry Local.</description>
