My name is Ankit Sarkar, Technical Architect by profession. I am from Kolkata, India. Recently,I moved to Nottingham, United Kindom for my new assignment.

In my day job at [Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)](https://www.tcs.com/), mainly focused on cloud migration and modernization of legacy applications. This allows me to give various application specific solutions based on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) services for business critical applications.
