In my day job at [Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)](https://www.tcs.com/), mainly focused on cloud migration and modernization of legacy applications. This allows me to give various application specific solutions based on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) services for business critical applications.
