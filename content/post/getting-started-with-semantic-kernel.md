Hi Everyone!

With this post, I am starting a new series about **{{< hl-text cyan >}}Semantic Kernel{{< /hl-text >}}**. Over the time, I will updated this page with links to individual posts : 

_This Post - Getting Started with Semantic Kernel_

In this post, we will try to understand the following concepts:

1. **What is Semantic Kernel?**
2. **How to use Semantic Kernel?**

Apart from that, we will also try to touch the concept of **LLM** and **Prompt Engineering**.
