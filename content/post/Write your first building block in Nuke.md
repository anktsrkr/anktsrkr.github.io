Hi Everyone!

This post is continuation of the series about a build automation tool called **{{< hl-text cyan >}}Nuke{{< /hl-text >}}** . Over the time, I will updated this page with links to individual posts : 

[Getting Started with Nuke](/post/getting-started-with-nuke/)

_This Post - Write your first building block in Nuke_

[Coming Soon - Manage your Package Version using Nuke](#)

[Coming Soon - Publish your Package to Github, Myget and Nuget using Nuke](#)

{{< toc >}}
## Effective changes
## What we are going to build?
## Write your first "Target" block in Nuke
## Generate the build script for "Github Actions"
## Run your first Nuke build



Yay! ðŸŽ‰ Your first build has now been set up, and you can run the build with the default implementation! though it will not do anything because we haven't added any build steps yet. 

In the next article, we will add some build steps to our build project and run it.
